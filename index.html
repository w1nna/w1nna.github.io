                <p>There are too many sites to keep up with all the work professors give out and it is easy
                    to forget and/or get overwhelmed.
                    Students experience the problem
                    The problem is evident in students grades that fall when they miss work out of confusion
                    or they canâ€™t find the due date on another site.
                    Students pay for their education and to fail a class can be a significant economic
                    problem</p>
